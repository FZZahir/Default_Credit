Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Madi M.,10/9/2022,"Yorba Linda, CA",5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. As a college student, this was my favorite place to study and as an adult it is the highlight of my neighborhood walk! Their food and drinks are phenomenal. My top recommendations:- Strawberry Banana Smoothie- Chocolate Chip Banana Bread- Breakfast Burrito (I do not meat but I've heard great things about all protein options!)- Iced Black Peach Tea The people are so friendly and you can just feel the community energy.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Victoria A.,9/10/2022,"San Francisco, CA",1,"I want to say I've been frequenting this coffee shop over the course of my college experience. Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future. I hope the cashier learns to be composed and professional at work even if they are having a bad day (I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on behalf of it being a possibility).",3,0,0
Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Margarita W.,8/23/2022,"Corona, CA",5,"I got a flat white here with a banana oat muffin. Most of the pastries, if not all, are organic. The size of the flat white was a little small but that's on me. Very moist muffin! Enjoyed it quite a bit. Paid with Apple Pay. Plenty of parking out front. They also have breakfast and lunch options but I haven't tried those yet. In addition, they sell lots of Christian paraphernalia like earrings, greeting cards, and stickers. If that's what you're into.",4,2,4
Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Les S.,6/7/2022,"Buena Park, CA",4,"Four stars is mainly for its offering of organic beans.  After reading about all the chemicals that go into regular coffee beans, I started seeking out organic options.  This and Lost Bean appear to be the only ones with that option.  I got a bag of Bali single origin beans, which is a dark roast.  I was actually looking for medium roast, but it only had light or dark roast beans at the time of my visit.  For dark roast, it tasted really good without being too bitter when I made myself a pour over with it at home.  My wife also loved the taste. Not quite sure on flavor notes, and there isn't a description on the bag, but it definitely has more of a nutty flavor than fruity.  In terms of actual drinks, I thought they were just ok.  I got a cappuccino to get a sense of its espresso based drinks.  The latte art was weak (even for a very basic design), and so was the flavor.  It was weak in espresso and too milky.  It tasted more like a latte than a cappuccino.  Also tried its cold brew, which was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Food was average too.  Grass-Fed Burger tasted clean, but overall flavor combination was pretty average.  Chicken & Artichoke Salad had good dressing, but the chicken was very dry.  I would definitely come back to buy its organic beans, but most likely won't get anything else.  Drink menu is very basic for coffee, but it does offer wine and beer.",15,7,15

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!! However....the location is full of people using it like it is a Starbucks. There is no where for you to sit and enjoy your food or coffee for that matter. Workers are not the friendliest and their scramble menu is a bit confusing because they only have 1 laminated 8X11 at the cashier that tells you what is in it. I would recommend putting the menu on one of the many chalkboards and not allowing people to sit with laptops for hours. While they say there is a 50min cap, there is no one keeping tabs. We were there and left and none of the people with their laptops left (even though they were all there beforehand)   But I do love their food.",0,0,1

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Victoria A.,9/10/2022,"San Francisco, CA",1,"I want to say I've been frequenting this coffee shop over the course of my college experience. Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!!

Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!! However....the location is full of people using it like it is a Starbucks. There is no where for you to sit and enjoy your food or coffee for that matter.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Victoria A.,9/10/2022,"San Francisco, CA",1,"I want to say I've been frequenting this coffee shop over the course of my college experience. Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future. I hope the cashier learns to be composed and professional at work even if they are having a bad day (I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on behalf of it being a possibility).",3,0,0

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!! However....the location is full of people using it like it is a Starbucks. There is no where for you to sit and enjoy your food or coffee for that matter.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Victoria A.,9/10/2022,"San Francisco, CA",1,"I want to say I've been frequenting this coffee shop over the course of my college experience. Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!! However....the location is full of people using it like it is a Starbucks. There is no where for you to sit and enjoy your food or coffee for that matter. Workers are not the friendliest and their scramble menu is a bit confusing because they only have 1 laminated 8X11 at the cashier that tells you what is in it. I would recommend putting the menu on one of the many chalkboards and not allowing people to sit with laptops for hours. While they say there is a 50min cap, there is no one keeping tabs.

Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!! However....the location is full of people using it like it is a Starbucks. There is no where for you to sit and enjoy your food or coffee for that matter.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Victoria A.,9/10/2022,"San Francisco, CA",1,"I want to say I've been frequenting this coffee shop over the course of my college experience. Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future. I hope the cashier learns to be composed and professional at work even if they are having a bad day (I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on behalf of it being a possibility).",3,0,0

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!! However....the location is full of people using it like it is a Starbucks. There is no where for you to sit and enjoy your food or coffee for that matter.

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Madi M.,10/9/2022,"Yorba Linda, CA",5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. As a college student, this was my favorite place to study and as an adult it is the highlight of my neighborhood walk! Their food and drinks are phenomenal. My top recommendations:- Strawberry Banana Smoothie- Chocolate Chip Banana Bread- Breakfast Burrito (I do not meat but I've heard great things about all protein options!)- Iced Black Peach Tea The people are so friendly and you can just feel the community energy. If you haven't been- this is a must try!",1,0,0

Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Victoria A.,9/10/2022,"San Francisco, CA",1,"I want to say I've been frequenting this coffee shop over the course of my college experience. Usually, the staff are quite welcoming and the coffee is good. Sadly, this was not my experience today. I don't ever mind waiting and I'm very polite but the cashier today gave me such a scathingly icy attitude and I laughed to break the tension when she asked for my preferred milk in the coffee - I was very polite and smiled and I could feel that for whatever reason she didn't like me which I just initially wrote off as maybe the staff is shy or tired, totally fine. The drink was weirdly sour tasting.Which is fine, everyone has a bad day and working customer service jobs are not easy - I would know. I've worked several service jobs throughout college. However after giving me this attitude, she proceeded to hand several people drinks who were waiting in line behind me or ordered after me to which I patiently waited for my drink. Disappointing to say the least, I'm not expecting 5 star service but I am expecting professionalism.The ambiance is great and typically - the staff are very kind but for whatever reason I was greeted with a rather frigid and unwelcoming attitude today despite my polite demeanor. Even worse my drink tasted sour but I didn't want to make the staffs day worse so I just beared with itI do not expect an apology but I hope the management takes this into careful consideration and has a nice chat with the woman working at the front today.The woman passing the food out was very nice and warm but the cashier I interacted with today was not. I hope this person's day gets better and hope that the customer service improves in the future. I hope the cashier learns to be composed and professional at work even if they are having a bad day (I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on behalf of it being a possibility).",3,0,0
Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Margarita W.,8/23/2022,"Corona, CA",5,"I got a flat white here with a banana oat muffin. Most of the pastries, if not all, are organic. The size of the flat white was a little small but that's on me. Very moist muffin! Enjoyed it quite a bit. Paid with Apple Pay. Plenty of parking out front. They also have breakfast and lunch options but I haven't tried those yet. In addition, they sell lots of Christian paraphernalia like earrings, greeting cards, and stickers. If that's what you're into.",4,2,4
Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Les S.,6/7/2022,"Buena Park, CA",4,"Four stars is mainly for its offering of organic beans.  After reading about all the chemicals that go into regular coffee beans, I started seeking out organic options.  This and Lost Bean appear to be the only ones with that option.  I got a bag of Bali single origin beans, which is a dark roast.  I was actually looking for medium roast, but it only had light or dark roast beans at the time of my visit.  For dark roast, it tasted really good without being too bitter when I made myself a pour over with it at home.  My wife also loved the taste. Not quite sure on flavor notes, and there isn't a description on the bag, but it definitely has more of a nutty flavor than fruity.  In terms of actual drinks, I thought they were just ok.  I got a cappuccino to get a sense of its espresso based drinks.  The latte art was weak (even for a very basic design), and so was the flavor.  It was weak in espresso and too milky.  It tasted more like a latte than a cappuccino.  Also tried its cold brew, which was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Food was average too.  Grass-Fed Burger tasted clean, but overall flavor combination was pretty average.  Chicken & Artichoke Salad had good dressing, but the chicken was very dry.  I would definitely come back to buy its organic beans, but most likely won't get anything else.  Drink menu is very basic for coffee, but it does offer wine and beer.",15,7,15
Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Sandy B.,7/22/2022,"Orange, CA",5,"Great place to enjoy some breakfast or lunch. Great food selections and coffee, tea, or smoothies too. Parking can be a challenge as it's in a small area. Good choice of seating in or out. Friendly service with a fun vibe.",2,0,1
Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Brittney E.,2/27/2022,"Orange, CA",5,"We love ordering coffee here when in the area!  They roast the beans on sight, have delicious pastries and kind employees. There is lots of parking in the center. Sometimes there is a line and can take a few minutes once ordered, be patient, it is worth the wait!",3,0,0
Tru Bru Organic Coffee,Karina E.,9/9/2022,"Anaheim, CA",4,"Food is great. Coffee....even the plain basic drip coffee is great. I can honestly say I LOVE IT!! However....the location is full of people using it like it is a Starbucks. There is no where for you to sit and enjoy your food or coffee for that matter. Workers are not the friendliest and their scramble menu is a bit confusing because they only have 1 laminated 8X11 at the cashier that tells you what is in it. I would recommend putting the menu on one of the many chalkboards and not allowing people to sit with laptops for hours. While they say there is a 50min cap, there is no one keeping tabs.
